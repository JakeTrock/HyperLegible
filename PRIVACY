HyperLegible Privacy policy:
Your site data will be manipulated by our application, however it will NEVER be sent to a remote server or stored by the extension in any way.
This extension simply exists to alter the font of text on a page, nothing more, nothing less. There are no remote resources in this application,
all fonts are cached locally and served from local files only. There will never ever be a case where this application will transmit or recieve data
from a remote server in any way, it is simply impossible given the limited functionality of the code. That said, you are free to check the single source
file over at https://github.com/JakeTrock/HyperLegible/ if you still possess any doubts. You will see it gets all of the pages body dom nodes, changes
their internal font styling and appends a reference to a local font on the top in the head element. This extension also ignores any accessibility flagged elements,
thereby ignoring elements with icon fonts, or any conflicting resources.

In short:
